# APFS Snapshots are somewhat limited by macOS in that they only exist for 24 hours after being created and are purged by the "deleted" daemon automatically after that time.
# I found 2 ways around this issue, and this LaunchDaemon script exists to perform whichever of these solutions it's capable of doing when it's run.

# Solution 1: MANIPULATE DATE AND TIME
	# Manipulate the date and time so that macOS never thinks 24 hours have passed. Through investigation I also found that if a Snapshot is in the future, macOS will purge it.
	# So, this script will compare the current date with the reset Snapshot date and set the date back to the reset Snapshot date so that macOS does not think 24 hours have passed.
	# Since Network Time must be turned off to set the date back, api.freegeek.org/datetime is used to keep the actual time in sync even though the date will be set back to the reset Snapshot date.
	# There is a possible edge case where the actual time could be earlier the reset Snapshots time, which would put the reset Snapshot in the future.
	# This is edge case is checked for and the time will be set to the reset Snapshot time if the actual time would put the reset Snapshot in the future.
	# To help avoid this issue, the time was set back to midnight when creating the reset Snapshot so that the reset Snapshot could really only be in the future for a few seconds near midnight.

# Solution 2: KEEP THE SNAPSHOT MOUNTED
	# This is a much better solution than manipulating the date and time (since internet things can get wonky when the date is wrong).
	# The issue with this solution is that a Snapshot can only be mounted by an app that has been granted Full Disk Access, and LaunchDaemon scripts cannot be granted Full Disk Access.
	# To workaround this limitation, I created the "Free Geek Snapshot Helper" AppleScript applet which can be granted Full Disk Access and then mount the reset Snapshot as soon as possible on each boot.
	# And, "Free Geek Snapshot Helper" will always be granted Full Disk Access right off the bat during a customized installation by "fg-install-os" (which you can read about in the comments in that script).
	# This script will always run "Free Geek Snapshot Helper" first, and check whether or not it was able to mount the reset Snapshot. If it was, Network Time will be left on (or turned on) and that will be all that is done.
	# If "Free Geek Snapshot Helper" could not mount the Snapshot (such as very early on boot or if something went wrong with "Free Geek Snapshot Helper" being granted Full Disk Access), this script will fallback to using the date and time manipulation solution.

# ANOTHER SNAPSHOT NOTE: macOS will also only keep 1 Snapshot per hour. If multiple Snapshots exist within the same hour, only the earliest one for that hour will be kept (unless a newer one has been mounted, then that one will also survive while mounted).

# CAVEAT FOR macOS 10.15 Catalina!
	# Even if the reset Snapshot is mounted to prevent it from being purged by the "deleted" daemon, "Restore from Time Machine Backup" in Recovery will not show the reset Snapshot if more than 24 hours has passed and the "deleted" daemon has run *which would* have purged it.
	# It seems that somehow the "deleted" daemon is maybe marking the reset Snapshot as unusable and preventing it from being able to show up in "Restore from Time Machine Backup" in Recovery. This seems to not be an issue on macOS 11 Big Sur though.
	# So, ALWAYS manipulate the system date (Solution 1) to keep set to the Snapshot date on macOS 10.15 Catalina and do not bother mounting the Snapshot (since knowing the Snapshot got purged is better user feedback than it just not showing in Recovery).

				# And we do not need to worry about any adjustments forward in time since this causes the LaunchDaemon to run immediately

				# I tried using "launchctl kickstart -k 'system/org.freegeek.fg-snapshot-preserver'" to only
				# reload this specific LaunchDaemon but since (I believe) the date change messed up the system-wide
