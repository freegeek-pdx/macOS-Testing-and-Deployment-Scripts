	-- "do shell script with administrator privileges" caches authentication for 5 minutes: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2065/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003093-CH1-TNTAG1-HOW_DO_I_GET_ADMINISTRATOR_PRIVILEGES_FOR_A_COMMAND_ & https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/AppleScript/RN-AppleScript/RN-10_4/RN-10_4.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000982-CH104-SW10
	-- And, it takes reasonably longer to run "do shell script with administrator privileges" when credentials are passed vs without.
	-- In testing, 100 iteration with credentials took about 30 seconds while 100 interations without credentials after authenticated in advance took only 2 seconds.
	-- So, this function makes it easy to call "do shell script with administrator privileges" while only passing credentials when needed.
	-- Also, from testing, this 5 minute credential caching DOES NOT seem to be affected by any custom "sudo" timeout set in the sudoers file.
	-- And, from testing, unlike "sudo" the timeout DOES NOT keep extending from the last "do shell script with administrator privileges" without credentials but only from the last time credentials were passed.
	-- To be safe, "do shell script with administrator privileges" will be re-authenticated with the credentials every 4.5 minutes.
	-- NOTICE: "do shell script" calls are intentionally NOT in "try" blocks since detecting and catching those errors may be critical to the code calling the "doShellScriptAsAdmin" function.
