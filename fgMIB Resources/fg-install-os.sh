	# ABOUT PERFORMING MANUALLY ASSISTED CUSTOMIZED CLEAN INSTALL ON APPLE SILICON

	# In recoveryOS on Apple Silicon, "startosinstall" does not work (which has not changed from macOS 11 Big Sur through macOS 13 Ventura, which is the current latest version at the time of writing this).
	# When "startosinstall" is run in recoveryOS on Apple Silicon, it simply outputs "startosinstall is not currently supported in the recoveryOS on Apple Silicon".

	# BUT, I've discovered a simple way to customize a clean install by tricking the installer into thinking it's an upgrade/re-install.
	# This process cannot be completely scripted and requires some user interaction, but it is the
	# best option on Apple Silicon from within recoveryOS until Apple makes "startosinstall" work.

	# The first important thing is to make sure the Apple Silicon Mac has been properly erased for a clean install.
	# This cannot be scripted (as far as I know) and requires manually running "Erase Mac" through GUI means.
	# If "Erase Mac" is not used and the internal drive is erased incorrectly, Secure Token/Volume Owner users may not be able to be created.

	# "Erase Mac" can be run from the Recovery Assistant menu (on first boot into recoveryOS if FileVault is enabled or by running "resetpassword" in Terminal to re-open Recovery Assistant).
	# "Erase Mac" can also be done by following the prompts in Disk Utility when erasing the internal volume group (I think these prompted were added to Disk Utility in macOS 11.2 Big Sur).
	# Since we are in Terminal at this point, the easiest option is to launch "resetpassword" to re-open Recovery Assistant and then display instructions on how to manually run "Erase Mac".

	# After "Erase Mac" has been run, the internal drive will be named "Untitled" on macOS 11 Big Sur or "Macintosh HD" on macOS 12 Monterey and newer and it will be empty except for the ".fseventsd" folder.
	# So, this is what we will check for to determine if "Erase Mac" has already been run and proceed with preparing the drive to trick the installer
	# into performing a upgrade/re-install as well as copying the customization resources (the same as when customizing an existing clean install).

	# Now, FOR THE UPGRADE/RE-INSTALL TRICK! Through trial-and-error, I found that simply the existence of the "/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist" file will make the installer perform
	# an upgrade/re-install process instead of a clean install. This means that any files or folders added into the filesystem are preserved instead of deleted during the installation process.
	# I first started with a valid "SystemVersion.plist" file, but through more testing I found that the contents of this file do not matter for the trick itself to work, and creating an empty one is enough.
	# BUT, whatever "/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist" we create will be moved to "/private/var/db/PreviousSystemVersion.plist" during the installation process.
	# Since I am not sure when/if/how this "PreviousSystemVersion.plist" may be used by macOS, it seems best to be safe and create a valid "SystemVersion.plist" in the first place.
	# Originally, I just copied the "SystemVersion.plist" from the current recoveryOS, but later realized that prevented installing older versions of macOS than the current version of recoveryOS.
	# When testing, it could be possible to be booted to the latest local recoveryOS but want to be able to install an older version of macOS. If I copy the "SystemVersion.plist" from the latest recoveryOS
	# the installer will think that version of macOS has been fully installed and will not allow a "downgrade". So, instead I decided to manually create the "SystemVersion.plist" for the oldest possible
	# version of macOS that could be manually installed on an Apple Silicon Mac, which is macOS 11.0.1 Big Sur (build 20B29) since 11.0 (build 20A2411) only came pre-installed on the first Apple Silicon Macs.
	# Installing older versions of macOS than the currently running recoveryOS is not allowed on non-Apple Silicon Macs since it can cause installation failures and it's always possible to boot to an older version of recoveryOS,
	# but on Apple Silicon Macs you cannot boot to an older version of recoveryOS since Internet Recovery no longer exists and "booting" to a USB installer actually still boots to the local recoveryOS.
	# And, with macOS 11 Big Sur and newer on Apple Silicon doing installations of older versions of macOS from the latest versions of recoveryOS appears to not be an issue as of at least macOS 13 Ventura.
	# Also, this was tested and confirmed to not cause any issue on 2021 14-inch MacBook Pro 18,3 which originally shipped with macOS 12 Monterey.

	# The one big important thing about this is that if you ONLY create the "SystemVersion.plist", the installation will fail and reboot into recoveryOS with an error stating
	# that "An error occurred migrating user data during an install." So, more trial-and-error testing was necessary. My first though was to extract the entire "/private/var/db/dslocal"
	# folder from a clean installation and copy it into place before starting the installation process, and this worked! But, I was concerned about having to check and maintain any changes over time
	# between different versions of macOS, as well as if there was any computer specific information stored in the "localhost.plist" file or others that should be freshly created during an installation.
	# In an effort to find the absolute least amount of actions necessary to make this trick work, I tried only creating certain "dslocal" folders and files to see what worked and what didn't.
	# To my delight, I found that ALL that needs to be created is an EMPTY "/private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default" folder!
	# If only the "/private/var/db/dslocal/nodes" folder or any less is created, the installation process will fail with the same error as stated above, but anymore is unnecessary.
	# The installer will properly create the default "dslocal" contents when only an EMPTY "/private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default" folder exists!
	# Also, this "/private/var/db/dslocal" folder containing the empty "Default" folder will be archived to "/private/var/db/dslocal_orig.cpgz" during the installation process.

	# NOTE: Both the leftover "/private/var/db/PreviousSystemVersion.plist" and "/private/var/db/dslocal_orig.cpgz" files will be
	# DELETED by "fg-prepare-os.sh" on first boot to make everything appear as a regular "clean install" like we really wanted.

	# The other concern about this process was permission issues between what the permissions are when folders are created in recoveryOS vs what they are supposed to be after a normal installation.
	# But, this appears to MOSTLY be a non-issue in my testing. The installation process appears to reset and correct MOST permissions for MOST files or folders created in recoveryOS.
	# EXCEPT for the "/Library" and "/Library/LaunchDaemons" folder, which does not get its group correctly changed from "admin" to "wheel", so that must be done manually as well.

	# Once these files and folder are created to trick the installer into performing the upgrade/re-install and our customization resources are also setup and copied in,
	# Install Assistant is launched to be manually clicked through since that is the only way to start an installation process within recoveryOS on Apple Silicon.
	# At this point we will just display instructions how how to manually start the installation.

	# So, that is the summary of all the checking and actions that are done below to be able to perform a customized clean install on Apple Silicon!
	# Of course, Apple Silicon Macs can also be put into DFU mode and restored via Apple Configurator 2 on another Mac and then that existing clean install can be customized by this script.
	# But, this option was fairly simple to add and is nice to have if a re-install is needed on an Apple Silicon Mac without needing to have another Mac on hand to do a DFU restore.

		# Only run "xartutil --erase-all" on T1 (*NOT* T2) Macs to clear any possible Touch ID data (since "bioutil" is not available in recoveryOS).
		# This used to also work fine on T2 Macs (and would do more than just clear Touch ID data) when I originally wrote this script when macOS 11 Big Sur was the latest version of macOS.
		# But, at some point between then and macOS 12.4 Monterey, something changed (likely in the bridgeOS T2 Firmware) that causes a MAJOR issue during the macOS installation.
		# If "xartutil --erase-all" is run at this point in recoveryOS on a T2 Mac, the installation will start fine and reboot to the Apple logo with progress bar phase.
		# Then, at some point during that phase (I think at the next reboot), the Mac will jut shut down and won't turn back on *AT ALL*, even manually, basically seeming to be a brick.
		# But, luckily, the T2 Mac can be put back into DFU Mode to restore the bridgeOS T2 Firmware to bring the T2 Mac back to life to be able to do another macOS installation attempt.
		# I'm not sure exactly when this change in the bridgeOS T2 Firmware happened since we don't get that many T2 Macs and I hadn't been testing each new version regulary.
		# Regardless, since every T2 Mac that comes in gets the bridgeOS T2 Firmware DFU restored (which securely cryptographically erases the T2 Mac by clearing encryption keys)
		# before this script is run anyways, running "xartutil --erase-all" as a secure erasure measure has never really been necessary for our process on T2 Macs anyways.
		# Now, since running "xartutil --erase-all" would cause a serious disruption to the refurbishment process for T2 Macs, it will just not be run anymore.
		# Also, even if we're not starting from a DFU restored state on a T2 Mac, simply erasing a volume (or disk) will automatically delete the associated xART sessions for any volumes being deleted/erased.

			# Like when doing customized clean installs for Apple Silicon (as described above), we also DO NOT want to always copy the "SystemVersion.plist" from the current version of recoveryOS onto the installation drive,
			# but for different reasons than allowing older versions of macOS than the current recoveryOS (which is not allowed on non-Apple Silicon Macs since it can cause installation failures and it's always possible to boot to an older version of recoveryOS).
			# It's because I found that having an existing "SystemVersion.plist" can change the drive format checks performed by "startosinstall" (which are never an issue for Apple Silicon since they are always APFS).
			# Specifically, "startosinstall" will check the macOS version in the existing "SystemVersion.plist" and if it indicates that macOS 10.14 Mojave or newer was already installed on the drive,
			# it makes the assumption that the drive must already be formatted as APFS (since macOS 10.14 Mojave was the first to convert all drives to APFS including HDDs and Fusion drives while macOS 10.13 High Sierra only converted SSDs to APFS).
			# But, since we are only tricking "startosinstall" into thinking there is an existing installation on the drive, this can be an issue when the Mac has never actually had macOS 10.14 Mojave or newer installed onto it and the EFI Firmware
			# does not support booting to APFS. When this happens, a sort of Catch-22 scenario can happen where "startosinstall" first checks the version in the "SystemVersion.plist" and sees that macOS 10.14 Mojave or newer is already installed
			# and then errors stating that "volume is not formatted as APFS" with exit code "223" on macOS 10.14 Mojave and macOS 10.15 Catalina and with exit code "5" on macOS 11 Big Sur and newer.
			# BUT, if we then try again with the drive formatted to APFS then "startosintall" will do the normal EFI Firmware version checks and if the EFI Firmware is too old to support booting to APFS,
			# then "startosinstall" will error again but this time stating that a firmware update or JHFS+ is required (exit code "253" on macOS 10.15 Catalina and older and exit code "5" on macOS 11 Big Sur and newer).
			# If the EFI Firmware is NOT too old to support booting to APFS, then installing macOS 10.14 Mojave with the drive formatted to APFS will work fine, but that is not a solution that could work for any and all Macs regardless of the EFI Firmware version.
			# So, when the EFI Firmware is too old to boot to APFS, we end up in a situation where "startosinstall" WILL NOT install macOS 10.14 Mojave and newer on either JHFS+ or APFS.

			# TO AVOID THIS POSSIBLE CATCH-22 WHEN THE EFI FIRMWARE IS TOO OLD TO SUPPORT BOOTING TO APFS, we can simply trick "startosinstall" into thinking an OLDER version of macOS is currently installed on the system which may still require the drive be converted to AFPS.
			# This way, we can always safely format the install drive to JHFS+ as we have always done (when NOT a T2 Mac) regardless of the EFI Firmware version and then just let the installer do the conversion from JHFS+ to APFS when it is supported (and after any necessary EFI Firmware updates are performed by the installation process).
			# In my testing I found that creating an EMPTY "SystemVersion.plist" file (just using the "touch" command) WORKS fine and "startosinstall" will seemingly still assume some version of macOS is already installed, but not assume that it's new enough to already be formatted as APFS.
			# But, I prefer to create an actual "SystemVersion.plist" file with valid contents, so I've chosen to always create it with the keys and values from a macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra installation.
			# Since macOS 10.13 High Sierra only converted SSDs to APFS (which could also have been opted-out of) and not HDDs or Fusion drives, it's old enough so that "startosinstall" knows that a conversion to APFS may be required and takes care of that for us without erroring that "volume is not formatted as APFS".
			# Also, this does not cause any issue on T2 Mac (even on a 15-inch 2019 MacBook Pro 15,1 which originally shipped with macOS 10.14.5 Mojave).
			# This ALSO avoids another possible issue when booting to Internet Recovery (such as on a T2 Mac) which happens to be newer minor version than the current macOS version we are trying to install via USB.
			# If we copied the newer "SystemVersion.plist" from Internet Recovery and then attempted to install the older minor version of macOS from the USB, we would get a "cannot downgrade macOS" error, which always creating this older "SystemVersion.plist" avoids.
