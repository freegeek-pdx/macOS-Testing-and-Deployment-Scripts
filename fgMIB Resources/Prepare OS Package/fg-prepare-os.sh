						# This Safari Container location is also protected: https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/containers.html
						# That article says the Safari Container is protected by SIP, but I think it's actually TCC since drag-and-dropping the location onto a Terminal window or granting Full Disk Access makes it accessible as well as manually trashing the folder in Finder. SIP wouldn't allow any of that.
						# But, since Safari hasn't been launched at this point, we can set the preferences in the old unprotected location and Safari will migrate them when launched for the first time.
						# This approach is also nice in that it supports any older versions of Safari which may be pre-installed on macOS 10.13 High Sierra through macOS 10.15 Catalina.

						# BUT: This no longer works in macOS 12 Monterey because the Safari Container is created upon login instead of first Safari launch.
						# The preferences within the Safari Container don't exist until launch, but the preferences from the old location DO NOT get migrated like they do on older versions of macOS because the Safari Container already exists.
						# Modifying the preferences within the Safari Container requires Full Disk Access TCC privileges.
						# Therefore, "Free Geek Setup Setup" will set these Safari preferences within the Safari Container location on first login since it will always be granted Full Disk Access right off the bat during a customized installation by "fg-install-os" (which you can read about in the comments in that script).

									# Setting StartCalendarInterval to run ever 5th minute instead of setting a StartInterval of 300 because want to be sure that fg-snapshot-preserver is always run at the top of every hour,
									# since 00:00:00 is the most important and StartInterval cannot guarantee that run time. Also want to run at the top of every other hour in case a network time sync changed the time resulting in the date needing to be updated at some time other than midnight.
									# And want to run every 5 minutes just to be extra safe and to allow for prompt manual time syncs if a previous manual sync failed or was blocked. Also want to have a more promptly logged record of when a reset Snapshot is lost, if that happens.
									# Also, if the reset Snapshot does somehow get lost, this will be used to launch "Snapshot Helper" which will display an alert about this critical error, which we want to be opened promptly and re-opened often if closed.
									# I tried using both StartCalendarInterval and StartInterval which seemed to work well at first (the StartCalendarInterval would actually reset the interval that StartInterval would run on which would make it pretty precise after the first hour had passed),
									# but extended testing showed that the StartInterval would eventually take precedence over StartCalendarInterval and it would not run right at 00:00:00 and the reset Snapshot could get deleted by macOS.
									# So, I switched to only using StartCalendarInterval which then made the actual issue apparent. The actual issue was that when the date was set to the past, the StartCalendarInterval would stop being processed until
									# the date and time caught back up to the next scheduled run before the date was set to the past, and that would only leave the StartInterval running since it was not dependent on a specifically scheduled run time.
									# To workaround this issue, the LaunchDaemon will now reboot the computer whenever the date is manipulated to make sure macOS runs the LaunchDaemon on the intended StartCalendarInterval.
									# See REBOOT AFTER DATE IS SET BACK IN TIME comments in fg-snapshot-preserver for more information about this.
									# This means that StartCalendarInterval and StartInterval could actually be used together, but now there is no real benefit to switching back to that over the existing StartCalendarInterval setup.

									# NOTE: See comments above in "Free Geek Setup" LaunchAgent setup about setting up this app with "AssociatedBundleIdentifiers" to properly display in the Login Items section in macOS 13 Ventura (including the following two commands being necessary).
									# This also requires the "fg-snapshot-preserver.sh" script being SIGNED with the same Team ID as the app of the AssociatedBundleIdentifiers, so that script is signed in the "build-fg-prepare-os-pkg.sh" script.

									# NOTE: These values are written by passing the commands to PlistBuddy via stdin instead of using "-c" args like is usually done.
									# One reason is because the contents are created dynamically using a loop instead of needing to hard code each 5 minute interval value which is clean and simple to do by creating a single string to be passed via stdin.
									# But, it would still be pretty trivial to create an array of "-c" commands dynamically to be passed to PlistBuddy all at once.
									# The more important reason is because there seems to be a bug in PlistBuddy where if you pass more than 14 "-c" args at once, it will crash with an "Abort trap: 6" error.
									# That is a big issue for *reading* values since when that crash happens none of the output can be piped or captured with command subtitution.
									# But, in the case of writing (like is being done below), the entire plist seems to still get created properly even though PlistBuddy will crash with the "Abort trap: 6" error.
									# So, to be extra safe and avoid crashing PlistBuddy, pass all the "Add" commands via stdin instead which seems to not ever crash PlistBuddy with any amount of commands that I've tested.
									# The only difference vs using "-c" args is that we have to end the set of "Add" commands with a "Save" command or else the plist will not be created
